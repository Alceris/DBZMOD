Dragon Ball Z Mod For Terraria!

(SMALL TUTORIAL)
You Will Start with a Empty scroll on character creation, this scroll will be used to make your first class based beam.
Your First class based beam will need Ki Gems, Which means you need to go find the new ki crystal ore, you will need a nightmare pickaxe at least to mine it.

Please List any bugs you find on my forum page or on my discord!
